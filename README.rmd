# Purpose

The aim of this folder is show my attempt to replicate two figures illustrating how different management fee structures effectively eat into investors overall cumulative returns. 

I was, unfortunately, unable to replicate the figures and calculate the impact on returns of different management fees. This tutorial however served as practice in using a project environment with the fmxdat package, using ggplot auxiliary functions, 




# Lastly

The point of this exercise was to investigate the "Tyranny of Fees"; how greater management fees impact investors cumulative returns. I have noted that a seperate column must be added for the "type" of management fee (ie the different scales) in order to change the color specification in the ggplot aesthetics. I look forward to learning how to be able to plot the figures, and continuing practicing using these tools in future tutorials.
